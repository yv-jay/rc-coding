# REDCap Coding Guidebook & Resources

## Welcome
The purpose of this guide is to be a repository of help with styling Vanderbilt University’s REDCap application surveys with the fundamentals of HTML & CSS as well as adding some cool functionality with JavaScript. This guide will attempt to give a background to some of the HTML/CSS fundamentals to make sense of some of the things I’ve found with REDCap as well as some examples that you can tinker with and images to try to demonstrate certain concepts.

## Guidebook

The guidebook for in depth explanations can be found here or on the rc-coding repo on Github:
